## What is this fund

This is the general development fund intended to cover costs related to Grin's ongoing development. While the team may not have visibility on every particular need that will arise, all donated funds will be used towards Grin's development or promotion.

This fund is managed entirely by the Grin Technical Council, and all spending decisions will be made public. The funds are kept in a 3/5 Multisig wallet, meaning no spending can occur without at least 3 council members actively signing the transaction.

Some examples of where proceeds of this fund might be allocated (by no means exhaustive and subject to change):

- Professional security audits
- Service fees related to build and deployment infrastructure
- Website design and/or development or other marketing materials
- Presence at conferences
- Contributing to developer campaigns or other specific development work if required
- Contributions toward open Grin ASIC design
- Legal support as and when needed

## Further Information

The Grin project is strictly non-profit. Please refer back to our [Funding overview page](funding) for details on our fundraising appoach and our inclusive development philosophy.

As always, anyone donating to this fund can optionally have themselves listed on the [Friends of Grin Page](friends).
