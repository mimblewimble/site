Grin node v4.1.0 has been released. Binaries are as usual available from the [download section]({{'download' | relative_url}}).

This release bumps the supported protocol version of the node, indicating support for “commit only” inputs in blocks and transactions. Nodes continue to be backward compatible with prior protocol versions. For more details, see [the announcement on the Grin forum](https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-node-v4-1-0-released/7840).

The version 4.x family of releases include many improvements and fixes, and is required in order to interact with the network after the scheduled hard fork. All users are encouraged to upgrade.

For more details, see the [post announcing version 4.0.0]({% post_url 2020-07-02-grin-4-released %}).
