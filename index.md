**Grin is still highly experimental technology**

[Grin](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin) is a blockchain and a
cryptocurrency focused on privacy and scalability. Grin is also an
implementation of the MimbleWimble transaction format with the extensions
required for a complete blockchain.

This site is geared toward developers or people who are willing to help grow a
technology that's still very early stage. If you're interested in the
cryptocurrency, how to use it or how to mine it, you will have to _wait until
it's ready_.

# Status

Grin's second testnet has been released! We need your help testing: if you're
able to compile from the source, see our [building guide](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/build.md).

We're currently hard at work in building the features required for [testnet3](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/milestone/5).
