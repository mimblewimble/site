**Grin is still highly experimental technology**

[Grin](https://github.com/ignopeverell/grin) is a blockchain and a
cryptocurrency focused on privacy and scalability. Grin is also an
implementation of the MimbleWimble transaction format with the extensions
required for a complete blockchain.

This site is geared toward developers or people who are willing to help grow a
technology that's still very early stage. If you're interested in the
cryptocurrency, how to use it or how to mine it, you will have to _wait until
it's ready_.

# Status

Grin's first testnet has been released! We need your help testing: if you're
able to compile from the source, see our [building guide](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/build.md).
This is our first testnet and more will come, with easier ways to run it, so
stay tuned.

# Community Funding

If you're an individual, company or institution excited about the potential of Grin or MimbleWimble, we humbly ask if you'd
consider making a financial contribution to the project's development. We're experimenting with a [100% community-driven 
funding model](funding.md), which we believe is the best way to keep Grin open and free from undue influence. More information
can be found on our [funding page](funding.md).
