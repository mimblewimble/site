        Without censorship or restrictions.

        Grin is designed for the decades to come, not just tomorrow. Grin wants to be usable by everyone — regardless of borders, culture, skills or access.

    <p>
      <span class="medium">Grin is a privacy-preserving digital currency</span> built openly by developers distributed all over the world.

      <span class="medium">Grin has no amounts and no addresses.</span> Transactions can be trivially aggregated. To hide the origin of a newly created transaction, it gets relayed among a sub-set of peers before it is widely broadcasted.

      <span class="medium">Grin is not controlled by any company, foundation or individual.</span> The coin distribution is designed to be as fair as possible, with an emission of 1 GRIN per second.

      <span class="medium">Mimblewimble</span> leverages cryptography to allow past transaction data to be removed with no compromise on security. This avoids Grin collapsing under the weight of data having to be kept on chain.
