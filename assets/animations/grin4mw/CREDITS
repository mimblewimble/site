'In anticipation for the upcoming Mainnet release this month, I commissioned an artist out of Milan to create an animation "GRIN FOR MIMBLEWIMBLE." The artist Sebastian Mazzucchielli is donating this work free for the use of the team. I think it is an excellent use of type and the line work speaks to the use of the Cuckoo Edge Trimming process. This is a gift and I think it will help promote the project.' - Dustin
